* Extended Time-to-live range for sessionless signals to 65000 seconds
* Added the ability to find advertisments on specific transports via the
  new API call: BusAttachment::FindAdvertisedNameByTransport()

Issues Addressed in Version 3.3.0
---------------------------------

ALLJOYN-1702: Session joiners should not receive sessionJoined callback since
this callback is only for the session creator.

ALLJOYN-(various): Fixed daemon deadlock/exit issues related to managed endpoint
refactoring

ALLJOYN-1850: BusAttachment constructor's concurrency parameter is ignored. 
Concurrency is always equal to 4.

ALLJOYN-1912: Clients can miss SessionMemberChanged indication(s) that occur too
close in time to SessionJoined event.

ALLJOYN-1916: Pre-installed daemon caches sessionless signals even after the sending
app has exited.

ALLJOYN-1918: LostAdvertisedName notification is not immediately received
after advertisement is canceled on a remote device.

ALLJOYN-1923: LostAdvertisedName is not received if requestName is not called.

ALLJOYN-1932: AllJoyn client drops messages that are received too soon after 
JoinSession() is called.

ALLJOYN-1937: Java binding cannot filter signals based on sender of signal.

ALLJOYN-1950: ProxyBusObject::MethodCall can fail with ER_BUS_NO_ROUTE when
using bundled daemon

ALLJOYN-1954: BusAttachment::Start can occasionally fail on Windows platform.



Compatibility
-------------

Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt for
use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not
inter-operate with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to send
messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the manifest
permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach external
AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE,
BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model of
AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).

Starting with version 2.5.0, AllJoyn control related callbacks such as
BusListener::FoundAdvertisedName cannot make AllJoyn remote procedure calls or
any type of blocking call without first enabling concurrent callbacks via the
new BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks() API.

Version 3.0.0 shipped with an issue (ALLJOYN-1423) that prevented earlier versions
of AllJoyn from seeing multicast advertisements produced by 3.0.0 based
applications. This issue was addressed in version 3.0.1.

Version 3.3.0 is the first version of the AllJoyn daemon that is compatible with
AllJoyn thin client usage. Older daemons cannot be used with AllJoyn thin-clients.

Starting with version 3.3.0, the AllJoyn Java binding call BusAttachement.registerSignalHandler()
no longer implicitly adds a match rule that allows all globally broadcast signals of
the given interface to be received. Beginning with version 3.3.0 of the Java binding,
the application developer is responsible for explicitly calling BusAttachment.AddMatch
with a rule that matches the globally broadcast signals that the app wishes to receive.

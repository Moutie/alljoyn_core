None

Issues Addressed in Version 3.3.2
---------------------------------

ALLJOYN-1761: Java binding crash due to BusAttachm not garbage collected before
VM exits

ALLJOYN-1946: alljoyn-daemon crashes when invoked with verbosity=5 and if the 
config file has <syslog/>

ALLJOYN-1965: WinRT: MethodReply(msg, args) should support args == NULL

ALLJOYN-1976: References to the ClientEndpoint are being held after the 
BusAttachment is stopped and joined

ALLJOYN-1982: Increase the maximum number of IODispatch threads to 128

ALLJOYN-1988 Do not attempt to remove b2b endpoints from virtual endpoints
they were never a part of. (affects sessionless signal delivery after many
iterations).

ALLJOYN-2004: Java binding Variant.getSignature needs to be public

ALLJOYN-2019: Make the symbol file of AllJoyn.dll as part of debug build
for Win8/RT

ALLJOYN-2024: TRANSPORT_TCP not defined for Java Binding

ALLJOYN-2078: Deadlock due to DoStopListen request when the TCPTransport 
is being stopped and joined

ALLJOYN-2010: Repeated join/leave session indicates possible memory leak 
in Alljoyn About service cpp. 


Known Issues
------------

ALLJOYN-2098: Rejected AllJoyn daemon connect attempts are not properly
retried with backoff

ALLJOYN-2100: Runtime failure using Java bindings with Java 7

ALLJOYN-2138: Memory leak seen when running ConsumerService on Linux and CUS22


Compatibility
-------------

Applications written for AllJoyn 1.X will need to be modified and rebuilt for
use with AllJoyn 2.0 and later.

The AllJoyn wire protocol related to encryption and authentication has changed
in the 2.1.0 release. AllJoyn interfaces that use security will not
inter-operate with devices whose AllJoyn version is less than 2.1.0.

The AllJoyn wire protocol was modified to have a 128kB maximum message size
starting with version 2.1.0. Earlier versions of AllJoyn which attempt to send
messages that are greater than 128kB will not inter-operate with versions
greater than or equal to 2.1.0.

Starting with version 2.2.0, AllJoyn clients on Android must obtain the manifest
permissions needed to access wifi and Bluetooth in order to reach external
AllJoyn nodes. These permissions are INTERNET, CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE,
BLUETOOTH and BLUETOOTH_ADMIN.

Starting with version 2.2.0 BusAttachment::Stop(bool) and
BusAttachment::WaitStop() were changed to BusAttachment::Stop() and
BusAttachment::Join() to be more consistent with the internal threading model of
AllJoyn (ALLJOYN-803).

Starting with version 2.5.0, AllJoyn control related callbacks such as
BusListener::FoundAdvertisedName cannot make AllJoyn remote procedure calls or
any type of blocking call without first enabling concurrent callbacks via the
new BusAttachment.EnableConcurrentCallbacks() API.

Version 3.0.0 shipped with an issue (ALLJOYN-1423) that prevented earlier versions
of AllJoyn from seeing multicast advertisements produced by 3.0.0 based
applications. This issue was addressed in version 3.0.1.

Version 3.3.0 is the first version of the AllJoyn daemon that is compatible with
AllJoyn thin client usage. Older daemons cannot be used with AllJoyn thin-clients.

Starting with version 3.3.0, the AllJoyn Java binding call BusAttachement.registerSignalHandler()
no longer implicitly adds a match rule that allows all globally broadcast signals of
the given interface to be received. Beginning with version 3.3.0 of the Java binding,
the application developer is responsible for explicitly calling BusAttachment.AddMatch
with a rule that matches the globally broadcast signals that the app wishes to receive.
